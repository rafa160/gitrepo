This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

The Project Runs in Flutter 2.7.
I have use bloc_pattern as State management, dio to request and GetX to snackbars and Navigations, FormBuilder lib to create forms and I also use Cached_image lib to deal with
the image network.

Application Flow.

Submit on the text form build some login name to try to find an user, if you get it one it will show
repositories info, user name, bio,city, stars and more.

The application its tested on Android 11, 10.
does not fit on web application.

- run flutter build apk to create a release-apk and install on your device or if you wish just run flutter run on your terminal.

- You also can check a simple test using mokito to check the api connection and the response data.
